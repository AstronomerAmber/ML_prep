Let's see two examples!


Connect-Four

1/ BOARD

User input grid size, start with a 4*4

2/ DROP PIECE
Place piece in board, alternating between players 1 and 2.
Pieces will stack on top of each other so make sure you build from the bottom up.

3/ WINNING MOVE
The game should work for two players and tell you when you have won, be it horizontal vertical or diagonal (4 in a row).

4/ MOVE IS VALID
Check for excepts: "Illegal move", "This column is full.  Try another one!", "The board is full!"

5/ 6x6 BOARD
Still only win by getting 4 in a row (vertically, horizontally, diagonally)
