Let's see two examples!
Connect-Four
1/ BOARD
User input grid size, start with a 4*4
2/ DROP PIECE
Place piece in board, alternating between players 1 and 2.
Pieces will stack on top of each other so make sure you build from the bottom up.
3/ WINNING MOVE
The game should work for two players and tell you when you have won, be it horizontal vertical or diagonal (4 in a row).
4/ MOVE IS VALID
Check for excepts: "Illegal move", "This column is full.  Try another one!", "The board is full!"
